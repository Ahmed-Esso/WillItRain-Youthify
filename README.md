## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

### Current Implementation

**Rain Prediction Algorithm:**
```python
# Factors considered:
- Season (Winter = higher probability in Egypt)
- Location (Coastal cities = more rain)
- Temperature (Cooler = higher probability)
- Historical patterns (Monthly averages)
- Random variation (Realistic unpredictability)

# Output:
- Binary decision (YES/NO)
- Confidence percentage (0-100%)
- Recommendation (Umbrella needed?)
```

**Temperature Forecasting:**
```python
# Methodology:
- Base temperature per city
- Seasonal adjustment (-8°C to +8°C)
- Daily variation (sine wave pattern)
- Random noise for realism

# Output:
- 10-day high/low predictions
- Weather condition icons
- Temperature range bars
```

## 🔬 Key Technical Insights

### 1. **Seasonal Adaptation for Egypt**
Egyptian climate has extreme seasonal variation:
- **Summer (Jun-Sep):** Very low rain probability (2%)
- **Winter (Dec-Feb):** Higher rain (35% coastal, 25% inland)
- **Spring/Fall:** Moderate transition periods

### 2. **Location-Based Intelligence**
```python
coastal_cities = ["Alexandria", "Port Said"]
if location in coastal_cities:
    rain_probability += 10%  # Coastal modifier
```

### 3. **Temperature Prediction Accuracy**
Base temperatures calibrated per city:
- Alexandria: 22°C average
- Cairo: 26°C average
- Aswan: 35°C average (hottest)

### 4. **Real-Time Updates**
App dynamically recalculates when:
- User selects new location
- User picks different date
- Prediction button clicked
